        <p>Checkout this small project I made for a tiny application
        launcher on windows: <a href="https://github.com/tsbaki/wmenu">wmenu</a>.
        It is pretty much a clone of <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">suckless' dmenu</a> 
        but for windows. The main reason behind creating this small
        tool is that I dislike using the windows basic taskbar search
        which sometimes doesn't suggest the programs I want to run and 
        it also tends to suggest files - sometimes miss typing
        your search causes it to open a web page (very annoying).</p>
        <p>I have tried the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run">PowerToys Run Utility</a>
        from Microsft but sadly it can be really slow when starting and I don't really care about the looks.
