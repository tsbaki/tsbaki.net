        <h2 class="date">Windows boot entry missing from Dual-Boot GRUB menu | March 15th, 2022</h2>
        <p>A recent GRUB update may have removed the windows menu entry from 
        the GRUB menu screen.</p>
        <p>This is the result of a new security measure by not including the
        <code>GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER</code> in the <code>/etc/default/grub</code>
        file by default.
        <p>Add the following flag to the grub file mentioned above: </br>
        <code>GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false</code>
        <p>Then running: </br>
        <code>grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</code> </br>
        should generate the updated GRUB configuration file which will now
        include the windows boot option in the GRUB boot screen.</p>

        <h2 class="date">Bitcoin & Crypto in general | March 9th, 2022</h2>
        <p>I really don't understand the hype behind bitcoin and how
        everyone is stating that this cryptocurrency has come to stay. I believe that is untrue - or so I hope.</p>
        <p>Using bitcoin as money would be terribly unpractical and here's why (IMO):<p>
        <ul>
            <li>A node in the blockchain has to validate whatever a block has and update the whole blockchain.
                This would cause an ordinary transaction (like paying groceries at the store) 
                to take an incredible amount of time; very inefficient. With a normal bank and currency, this takes seconds.</li>
            <li>If you do end up buying anything with cryptocurrency and somehow you find that you're unhappy
                with the item you just bought, i.e. it's damaged, you can wave goodbye to your bitcoin because, by nature,
                this is an irreversible action in the blockchain.</li>
            <li>Crypto is praised for its annonimity however I'm confident that most people use platforms like coinbase or
                binance to hold their private keys. Well, these companies can now tie your identity to these private keys...</li>
            <li>People are not interested in the cryptocurrency but rather on how they can profit (in non-digital currency) from buying/selling it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Crypto in general has a terrifying carbon footprint. In fact, bitcoin alone, takes up more electricity and the 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index/comparisons">whole of the Ukraine</a>.</p>
        <p>Oh and look, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hostmine.uk/mining-options/rent">rent computing power to mine crypto</a>. So much for "decentralization"...</p>

        <h2 class="date">wmenu | February 10th, 2022</h2>
        <p>Checkout this small project I made for a tiny application
        launcher on windows: <a href="https://github.com/tsbaki/wmenu">wmenu</a>.
        It is pretty much a clone of <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">suckless' dmenu</a> 
        but for windows. The main reason behind creating this small
        tool is that I dislike using the windows basic taskbar search
        which sometimes doesn't suggest the programs I want to run and 
        it also tends to suggest files - sometimes miss typing
        your search causes it to open a web page (very annoying).</p>
        <p>I have tried the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run">PowerToys Run Utility</a>
        from Microsft but sadly it can be really slow when starting and I don't really care about the looks.
